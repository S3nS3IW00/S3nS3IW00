## Hi 👋

I’m a **Full-Stack Software Developer** working in the **financial sector**, with experience in developing, maintaining, and operating business-critical systems.

At my current role, I work on a financial and debt-management system built with **Java (JavaFX)** on the frontend and **Python (Flask, SQLAlchemy)** on the backend. My responsibilities include backend and frontend development, REST API design, database work, and **Linux-based server environments**, as well as maintaining and upgrading legacy PHP applications.

I enjoy working across the full stack, from application logic to infrastructure, and I value choosing technologies based on the problem rather than sticking to a single toolset.

Here on GitHub, you’ll find a mix of **active and archived projects**, including libraries, desktop applications, and backend services, reflecting both professional and personal development work.
