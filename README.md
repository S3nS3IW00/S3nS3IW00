### Hi there 👋

I am currently working as a Fullstack Developer at a financial company. My main task is to maintain the company's financial system that was written in Java/JavaFX (fontend) and Python (backend). Aside of maintaining this system, I also have to migrate some websites to a newer version of PHP. When I say Fullstack I am not only mean frontend and backend, but also server management. The company has linux servers therefore I gained some skills in linux environments.

I love to spend my spare time with coding, as my Github profile shows, I have uploaded some of my work. Most of them are discontinued, but I have one that I currently work on.

### 👨‍💻 My tech stack
I believe that language has to depend on the task rather than on comfort zone.
#### Java
My first language, I started programming in it because of Minecraft servers. I also have some experience in Spring Boot.

#### Flutter
I love that how it makes mobile development such an easy thing.

#### Python
Not my faviourite to be honest, but I have to deal with it in my everydays, therefore I have some experience in it as well. 

#### Lua
I started learning it because of GTAV. I wanted to create a server with my friends, and for that it is essential to learn Lua.
I know only the basics of it that is neccessary to develop a GTAV server in the FiveM framework.

#### C#
I used to work on school projects in WPF that is a C# framework. My thesis was a game that was also written in C# WPF.
